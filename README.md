#A Proveably random contract

##About

This will be code that generates a truly random lottery contract

##What do we want it to do?

1. users will first pay to enter the raffle and the earnings will go to the winner
2. after a set period of time, the contract will randomly select a winner
3. we will use chainlink automation and VRF to achieve randomness and the time-triggers

##Test section

1. after we make some scripts, we will also write our tests
2. first we'll work locally, then on a forked testnet, then on a forked mainnet
